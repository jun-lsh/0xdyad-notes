# Do We Need Another CDP?

MakerDAO/DAI was a CDP that survived the bear market without some dramatic depegging event, which from a purely economic point of view doesn't make much sense (when ETH was in free fall in say, 2018, why wouldn't people want to unlock their ETH instead of _putting more in_?) until you realise a lot of the inflows were old money seeking to keep the project afloat.

Other CDPs may not have the same luck.

DYAD's whole selling point is the Kerosene token. In their own marketing words: 

_"If LUSD had KEROSENE it would activate ~$450m that's currently sitting idle waiting to absorb volatility. If Maker had KEROSENE it would unlock ~$8.8b."_

Although the Kerosene idea sounds inviting, the methods in which the "DYAD flywheel" keeps spinning is through an unfettered model of continual TVL growth (as opposed to, like, just token pumping) so that the "3-figure APRs" can be maintained â€” something achievable with suspiciously pyramidally shaped structures, but something that's sustainability can be put into question outside of a bull market.

As of time of writing (2024/06/27), the APR of USDC-DYAD has already fallen from ~130% down to 63%, and this isn't due to TVL dropping but simply the market price of Kerosene falling under the DV and continuing to fall.

Kerosene relies on arbitrage to be able to keep it's market price close to the DV which the protocol uses, but arbitrage is gated by the increasing paywall of requiring a Note to mint DYAD.

Furthermore, Kerosene's sole utility right now as a token is to be able to be deposited back into notes to increase your collateralization ratio and reduce your liquidation risk, yet Kerosene's value (and thus ability to behave as "pseudocollateral" as it isn't, like, actual ETH or something) is intrinsically tied to the overcollateralization of DYAD. 

There's a bit of ouroboric logic in play here where your cycle of rapid appreciation and massive yields can easily spin in the opposite direction, leading to rapid devaluing of Kerosene and mass liquidations when folk with collateralization ratios propped up by Kerosene itself start getting gutted.

Overall, I'm not too sure about this project. It's interesting, yes, but no way a "solution to the stablecoin trilemma", and the Kerosene token just sounds like a ticking time bomb to me.
