# Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)

To preface, let's briefly explain what a CDP based stablecoin is.

## Mechanism

Recalling our example of DAI, you use cryptocurrency as collateral for the stablecoin. The way this is performed is by locking up your crypto assets in a smart contract (which is how it becomes collateral), then the appropriate amount of DAI stablecoin is issued accordingly. 

When locking up your assets, the amount of DAI issued against the amount of collateral added is your Collateralization Ratio, which DAI requires to be _at least_ 150% (which they dub the Liquidation Ratio). 

If your collateral value falls under the Liquidation Ratio, you don't lose your entire collateral; A penalty is first applied (13% of your loaned DAI) followed by collection of a Stability Debt, which is seized and then sold. You're then free to claim however much collateral is left after your liquidation.

The "debt" part comes from the fact that the DAI generated behaves as a decentralized loan which is backed by your collateral â€” to unlock the collateral, you need to pay back the loan + "stability fees", a way that supply and demand imbalances are addressed. 

## Risks

Nothing is risk free. 
- Your Collateralization Ratio has to be maintained so you don't get liquidated during a market downturn
- The above is especially important when you leverage CDPs
- The stability fee, liquidation ratio and liquidation penalty are all subject to change
- Depegging can still occur, of course, especially since price fluctuations often rely on arbitrageurs to resolve them

# DYAD's Approach to CDPs

DYAD, which stands for... nothing, apparently, is also an overcollateralized CDP based stablecoin like DAI, but it claims to achieve greater capital efficiency than DAI, being "optimized for unit economics" (whatever that's supposed to mean).
