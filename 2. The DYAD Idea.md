# Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)

To preface, let's briefly explain what a CDP based stablecoin is.
## Mechanism

Recalling our example of DAI, you use cryptocurrency as collateral for the stablecoin. The way this is performed is by locking up your crypto assets in a smart contract (which is how it becomes collateral), then the appropriate amount of DAI stablecoin is issued accordingly. 

When locking up your assets, the amount of DAI issued against the amount of collateral added is your Collateralization Ratio, which DAI requires to be _at least_ 150% (which they dub the Liquidation Ratio). 

If your collateral value falls under the Liquidation Ratio, you don't lose your entire collateral; A penalty is first applied (13% of your loaned DAI) followed by collection of a Stability Debt, which is seized and then sold. You're then free to claim however much collateral is left after your liquidation.

The "debt" part comes from the fact that the DAI generated behaves as a decentralized loan which is backed by your collateral — to unlock the collateral, you need to pay back the loan + "stability fees", a way that supply and demand imbalances are addressed. 

## Risks

Nothing is risk free. 
- Your Collateralization Ratio has to be maintained so you don't get liquidated during a market downturn
- The above is especially important when you leverage CDPs
- The stability fee, liquidation ratio and liquidation penalty are all subject to change
- Depegging can still occur, of course, especially since price fluctuations often rely on arbitrageurs to resolve them

# DYAD's Approach to CDPs

DYAD, which stands for... nothing, apparently, is also an overcollateralized CDP based stablecoin like DAI, but it claims to achieve greater capital efficiency than DAI, being "optimized for unit economics" (whatever that's supposed to mean).

## Tokenizing Collateral 

What differentiates DYAD from other CDP stablecoins is it's utility token, _$KEROSENE_. Kerosene is a token that is valued based on the surplus of collateral, which you can then deposit back in like collateral (we will discuss this more later).

Being precise, the _deterministic_ value of Kerosene (which is the value of Kerosene that the contracts DYAD employs will use as reference) is set to be:
$$X = \frac{C-D}{K}$$
- $X$ is the value of a single Kerosene token
- $C$ is the total exogenous collateral (excluding deposited Kerosene)
- $D$ is the total supply of DYAD stablecoins
- $K$ is the total supply of Kerosene tokens

Thus, Kerosene is directly tied to how overcollateralized DYAD is and its overall TVL. 

You may trade Kerosene in a secondary market, where it can trade higher or lower than the deterministic value. The idea is that if it were to trade lower than the deterministic value, since you can deposit Kerosene as if it is collateral for DYAD, you can then receive more DYAD for cheaper — this arbitrage should push the price back up.

This is DYAD's key feature. With tokenized collateral, you can then use these tokens to bump up your collateralization ratio, which in turn means you can have a "100% collateral ratio" (where your extra 50% to achieve overcollateralization is made up of $KEROSENE), making the stablecoin more capital efficient. In other words, granting utility to otherwise idle collateral.

Let's put a pin on this and revisit it later.
## Gating Participation with Notes

In order to participate in the minting and redemption of DYAD, you need to buy a DYAD NFT called a "Note", which price increases by 0.001 ETH on every subsequent mint (currently, for the 647th note, it will cost 0.632 ETH).

Your collateral is stored in a bunch of ERC-4626 vaults, where you receive some amount of "share tokens" tied to your Note which is proportional to how much of the vault's collateral you are entitled to. (I can't find anything on these "share tokens" in the contracts :p)

The [DNft.sol](https://github.com/DyadStablecoin/contracts/blob/main/src/core/DNft.sol) contract itself doesn't contain any interesting logic (besides the existence of "Insider NFTs", a limited run of 4000 Notes with a fixed price of 0.1 ETH), and it is essentially used as a "key" to access functionalities. Without it, you can't interact with the vaults at all.

## Liquidations

There's something beautiful about the DYAD Docs description of liquidations being [just 2 paragraphs long](https://dyad.gitbook.io/dyad-docs-v2/overview/liquidations), when Maker's is like [5 whole sections](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/dog-and-clipper-detailed-documentation).

From what we can gleam:
- Other users can liquidate you if your collateral value falls under the 150% threshold
- Liquidators will repay the outstanding minted DYAD, then receive some collateral + a 20% bonus on top of that
	- The "repayment" is done by burning an equivalent amount of DYAD
	- Analysing the actual [VaultManager.sol](https://github.com/DyadStablecoin/contracts/blob/fc4ae90c125ae82a1e0e83a3fb2ad69d15a6c4c8/src/core/VaultManager.sol#L145), we can see that the collateral you receive is equal to $((cr-1)*0.20 + 1)/cr$ of the existing collateral (where $cr$ is the collateralization ratio). If their $cr$ went under 1.0, you just receive all the collateral.
- Partial liquidations (an idea introduced only after the [recent C4 audit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad/tree/main)) allow multiple users to liquidate one whale so that bad debt doesn't accumulate
