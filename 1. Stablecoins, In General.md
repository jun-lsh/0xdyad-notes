# The Stablecoin Trilemma

Stablecoins are finnicky. They're very much a necessity in the realm of crypto: a cryptocurrency pegged to some reference market value that _should_ remain unaffected by market volatility. However, this is a non-trivial task.

You could have a fiat-collateralized stablecoin, in which the virtual stablecoin reflects some real world assets backing it or a reserve of assets. 

Perhaps a crypto-collateralized stablecoin? Sounds a bit counterintuitive when you're trying to back a "stable" cryptocurrency with highly volatile assets.

How about algorithmic stablecoins which maintain their peg by adjusting supply based on demand? [This couldn't possibly go wrong.](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/05/22/anatomy-of-a-run-the-terra-luna-crash/)

Well, these three approaches are reflections of the Stablecoin Trillema:
- Peg security (Stability)
- Capital efficiency
- Decentralization

## Peg Security

The most intuitive approach is the 1:1 fiat-collateralized approach to creating a stablecoin. Mint tokens at an equivalent supply to how much cash you actually have to enable redemptions. However, maintaining 100% USD reserves (in the case of USD pegged stablecoins, of course) in cash or some equivalent is a... tall order.

In a decentralized world, it seems a bit backwards to then rely on a centralized authority to be minting stablecoins and on top of that, having to trust that they have the assets to back it. However, even with all your fancy algorithms, nothing really beats cold hard cash. At the end of the day, USDC and USDT are still the most widely used stablecoins, so...

## Capital Efficiency

Capital efficiency refers to how much collateral is needed to keep the stablecoin, well, stable. For example, our 1:1 fiat backed stablecoins are as capital efficient as you can get as you only need 1 USD of collateral for 1 USD worth of a token.

On the other hand, a decentralized solution like DAI which has reserves in ETH, USDC, WBTC, etc. would have to be overcollateralized to make up for the volatility of its backing assets, making it less capital efficient (it's currently overcollateralized by about 25%, with $8.52B of assets backing a supply of 6.78B tokens). Yes, this decentralizes your token further, but it also puts it at risk of depegging if some black-swan event were to occur tanking ETH's price.

## Decentralization

As mentioned above, decentralization is a sticking point because after all, we're operating in a decentralized, un(der)regulated market! Why should I have to place my faith in a centralized authority to be able to make use of stablecoins, especially when [they too can get rekt](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/12/circle-scrambles-to-right-usdc-after-signature-bank-failure/)? 

USDC was already supposed to be as good as it gets for a heavily audited, fiat-backed stablecoin, and even it depegged when SVB fell. In line with our standard crypto ecosystem arguments, we'd rather have non-custodial decentralized stablecoins with _full transparency_ rather than the opaque nature of centralized tokens. 

(Although, whether stablecoins can truly be decentralized [is still a big question mark](https://bizbeat.nus.edu.sg/thought-leadership/article/decentralised-stablecoins-are-impossible/))

## The Best of Three Worlds

It's not called a trilemma for nothing. The problem we face here is that these three properties underlying stablecoins are at constant odds with one another; usually, to have 2 out of 3 of these properties, you'd have to toss the third under the bus.

Honestly, from a user's perspective, what matters is probably:
- Stability itself
- Being able to earn yield and counteract inflation
- Some level of decentralization

Solving the trilemma, inarguably, would be the best case scenario â€” the question now is whether such a solution would be reliable enough that it'd dethrone the convenience and "proven effectiveness" of the existing, "2/3-complete" solutions that we work with today.
